### IMDB-faceted-search
*Database project* **Orcale DB**.  
Developed a data analysis application for imdb.com user's review data with emphasis on database infrastructure.
* Designed a target standalone java application which runs queries on the MovieLens/imdb data and supports two types of search: Movie search and User search.
* Implemented faceted search for accessing information organized by applying multiple filters/facets as movie attributes like genre, year, country, cast and movie tags. The previous facets are remembered as the search goes further and the search space gets narrowed down.
* Populated the database (Oracle 11g), communicated with it and ran searches using JDBC connections. Implemented indexing on the huge data of over 2000 users, 10000 movies, 85000 ratings, 13000 tags and reduced the search area thereby improving the performance of the application
